This repo contains the frontend code of my final year project NEMO- no emails missed,organised. The frontend consist of 2 clients - a chrome extension and an electron desktop sidebar. This repo exclusively contains the code related to the chrome extension. Currently in polishing phase.


Both extension and sidebar are not the same ,   the sidebar is more detailed ,  the extension is designed in such a way to make it lightweight at the same time relect and mirror the desktop sidebar.

Both the frontend clients have the same backend skeleton and use the same logic.
